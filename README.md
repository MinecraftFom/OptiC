# OptiC
**我优化了（某种意义上）c语言的代码，让他像汇编（就是汇编的风格，不是语法），减少了输入符号的过程，只需要空格和字母就能搞定。**
                                      
**I optimized (not really) c's code to let it looks more like assembly's style. While coding, you don't need to type in symbols, only using spaces and charactors are needed.**

**备注： 不要问作者为什么给变量取这个名字，反正就是我想，没有其他原因，没有其他含义**
**P.S. Don't ask the author why named the global vars like this, that's all I want, no other reasons, no other meanings.**
